Project: Battleship

Group Member Names: Michael Alex Lynch, Colin Alexander

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

Alex - I hope to gain a better understanding of class interaction and visually oriented programming. The first time I worked on this project I was very confused and I am excited to see how my programming "muscles" have developed.

Colin - Class interaction and scope, learned alot and struggled alot in Flash_Cards.
Looking forward to strengthen this knowledge.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

Our team strengths include maturity and professionalism. We are both committed to doing our best on this project, and to treat it as a real-life project for a career.

Our collaboration style is to speak honestly and candidly with each other, and to keep each other updated on our thoughts & ideas.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):

Alex - I am available to work together every day before 7PM at night.

Colin - I am available sometimes in the AM, but most often after class until 8pm.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):

We will communicate on a near daily basis to schedule time to work on the project. Communication will be done through Slack messages & Slack calls, as well as in person.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Alex - I am a repeater so I bring the strength of familiarity with the project to the table. I hope to improve on my understanding of setting up the board class.

Colin - Confidence with classes and scope, as well as the board grid functionality,
as well as possible uses with that functionality.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

For the the bulk of the project we will work together side by side or through zoom to simultaneously contribute to the project in driver/navigator or ping-pong fashion. We may also contribute individually on our own, utilizing branches and detailed pull requests on Github to advance the project.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

Our workflow expectation is to commit every new method created, and utilize a new branch for each section of coding. Pull requests will be reviewed jointly and will include detailed commentary about new methods created and their functions.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):

We will use Github for project management.

Day 1 Agenda: Day 1 Agenda is to get the repository initialized and created on
Github, as well as complete the DTR memo.
